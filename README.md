I have been programming in LabView for myrio, font and backend web develop.

我曾用LabView控制myrio機器人，也曾經做過前端和後端。

haskell is Minimalism and static typed, well optimized, that improved the code we write.

Programming with LabView are easy to write wrong since it not easy to read, but LabView provides lots of libarys.
OOP can found in LabView, but some advance feature (fuction pointer, high oreder function, metaprogramming, error handling) not.

Nim's syntax is similar to many language(expression can more then one line, and has many way to call function),  builtin support for metaprogramming.
I think Nim implements OOP and some functional feature in C, including dynamic function, dynamic dispatch method, lambda function.
Nim let us product cross platform (C/C++/Objc/Javascript) code, we can use thread, socket, and many standard modules, haskell does, too.
compare to Nim's and Lua's source code, Cpython, Rust, Haskell is really large.
